This would detract from the crucial educational focuses of their role, and could lead to compromising standards as they would now be trying to manage more complex tasks in fewer work hours.\n\nLastly, reducing the amount of time teachers spend in the classroom could unintentionally devalue the profession as a whole. On the surface, it appears to be a reasonable notion; reducing the hours teachers spend in the classroom would limit their exposure to stress and provide more leisure time. It would also add additional strain on teachers, who would be responsible for teaching more material to a larger class in reduced time frames.\n\nIn addition, fewer teacher work hours could lead to the primary instructors being asked to take on additional roles in the school, such as extracurricular activities and guidance support. This would lead to an overall decrease in the quality of education provided, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a teacher to manage a larger number of students. However, this decision carries many far-reaching implications that ultimately make such a move inadvisable.\n\nFirst and foremost, reducing teacher work hours would likely result in an increase in class sizes. \nThe debate over reducing work hours for school teachers is one that has caused much contention in recent years"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Human-Like: Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week.

Action will delineate and define you.” This quote emphasizes the importance of being active and how through action we define ourselves. On the other hand, remaining idle and being unwilling to take charge of our lives can lead us away from our goals. Therefore, it is important that we take a stand for ourselves and for others in the world so that we can bring positive changes for generations to come."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Human-Like: This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing.

It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"Determine never to be idle... This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life.

A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see.. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education.\n\nSecond, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place.

There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone.\n\nFor starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices"}]}]}

When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest.\n\nWhile being inactive there will be time where you can rest. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or i'll be caught in a family emergency.\n\nOverall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isn't always true.

The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career.

Sometimes some of them feel like they are getting rejected by the community and they just to want to be alone crying or even want to commit suicide. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. Some people get lost trying to be someone else that they are not because the society want to change them.\n\nFor example, in some countries, especially my country, Haiti, people get bullied for being in the LGBT community. If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where they've lost it and they would also find happiness. Some parent, family members, or friends might not accept them for who they really are, so they have to hide it and try to be normal like every body else. This is one reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\n\nSecondly, people get a chance to be their real selves. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \"to be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" I strongly agree. You do not try to please others. Deep down inside they don't really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. No confidence make people look weak and they don't believe much in themselves. Have you ever felt like you have to be someone else you are not? This is something that most people who living in this world are dealing with. However fighting this obstacle can improve their lives and build them up to have more confident. you become more confident. Therefore fighting with this world to be ourselves is one the greatest accomplishment because, people become more confident, they get the chance to be their real selves, and they don't try to please others.\n\nFirstly, people become more confident. As an example, some people may have terrible stuttering problems, and sometimes it may make them feel like not wanting communicate with others, or some people would love to have a conversation, but they might think that they are going to get laughed at because it's hard to get their words out. This is a last reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\n\nAs a summary, be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Us human being live in a world nowadays that is actually don't want us to be ourselves, no matter how hard we try, we most likely end up not being confident, and having low self esteem. Some people would do absolutely anything to please their significant others or their friends. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true"}]}]}

Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time.

The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework.

That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.\n\nLast reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.\n\nSecond reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.\n\nin conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.\n\nWell I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons"}]}]}

It is also useful in situations where a student may have a disability or another condition that makes attending a physical school difficult.\n\nFor instance, a case study of a student in the US revealed the immense challenges they faced due to distance learning. Compared to a physical school, distance learning can present a range of social problems and may negatively affect a person's mental wellbeing if they find themselves too isolated or do not have adequate support. \nDistance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students across the world who find themselves unable to access a physical school. One of the main advantages of distance learning is that it offers educational opportunities beyond geographical boundaries and students of any age have access to extensive resources. While students may have access to many educational resources, nothing truly replaces the valuable experience of learning, growing, and connecting with peers in a physical school setting..

I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.\n\nAt the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves"}]}]}

Failure can help sharpen our skills, belief in ourselves, and provide an authentic platform to persevere towards success.. \nWhen I look at failure, the first thing I think about is how much I have learned from personal experiences. It can be a pivot point where people decide to stand up, take action, and strive towards their goals with increased ambition and determination.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that failure can have tremendous benefits for humans in the long run. By failing and coming to terms with the failure, I was able to develop a better understanding of how to work smarter and plan for things better in the future. Failure can also be seen as a learning experience and spark self-reflection, as it gives people an opportunity to reassess their current strategies and formulate a better plan or approach.

Most companies look for specific characteristics in potential employees. But sometimes those people aren't good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things I'm able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job. Thank you for reading and taking my application for consideration. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, I'll do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give.

I think I'm a very good candidate because, I'm good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally I'm may not have much experience on this kind of work but I'm a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job.\n\nOne reason, I think I should be hired is that I'm good working with people.

On the soccer team, I pushed myself to excel on the field, eventually becoming team captain in my senior season. To quote the artist himself, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” By seeking to challenge one’s self and remaining ambitious, a person can submit themselves to a path that may be difficult, but will ultimately lead to success in the long run.. In the professional world, I chose to take the time and actively explore new opportunities that have let me grow as an individual and be successful as a professional. Similarly, while looking for a job after college, I was all too happy to take the first offer that came my way, rather than researching other opportunities that could have made for a challenging, yet rewarding career.\n\nAs time passed and I set my goals higher, I began to see the positive repercussions of this decision. Both of these present a clear link between Michelangelo’s words and my own experiences. With any effort we put forth in life, we must challenge ourselves to set goals that will push our limits and boundaries, so that we can reach our maximum potential.\n\nAs seen in my own life, Michelangelo’s words serve as a reminder that setting our sights too low is a greater danger than failing to reach an ambitious goal"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Human-Like: I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out.\n\nAnother reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.\n\nAnd won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.\n\nAlso another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.\n\nIn conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.. I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.\n\nOne good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me"}]}]}

That's why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldn't have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers don't want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer.

This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.\n\nThe student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.\n\nHowever, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.\n\nSecondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. Many are addicted to social media, and have the \"need\" to check it every 10 minutes. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.\n\nInitially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help."}]}]}

Listening to professionals can provide helpful information, but one must always exercise their own judgment and be aware of their own feelings and thoughts. Ignoring your intuition and making the wrong decision can have dire consequences, ranging from missed opportunities to poor physical or mental health. This way, one can ensure that their decision is well informed and considered..

However, part of your decision needs to come from your heart.\n\nFirstly, If you want to accomplish a dream in your life you need to put some extra work trying to get it done. What I do when I have to take a decision of doing something is to think the decision twice.\n\nIn conclusion, never give up a decision of you doing the right thing. Other people who you should talk to are your siblings. Always do what your parents says or ask you to do because they are the ones who wants you to accomplish your dreams, be there when they need you, talk to them when you need to. For example, lets say you are a soccer player and you have a game but you don't trust your team mates what is going to happen is that you might lose that game. The idea of going to school should be one of the most important things you should do.\n\nThirdly, asking for help in taking a decision is not a bad idea. Example, one day I made a bad decision of not cleaning the back yard of my house for like three months and it was fall and what happened was that it got full of leaves. Putting some trust on your decision can help you do what is right or wrong. Also, getting it done is not going to be easy but sometimes you need to try. For example, if you want to ask someone what you should do after graduation must come from you but sometimes you can ask questions to your family and talk about it, they might know what is the right thing you should do.\n\nPeople agree with you taking your own decisions than doing what other says. I know is hard to trust someone who doesn't act or look the same as you. Ideas are part of what you should take seriously in your life.

The answer is not quite so straightforward. However, generally speaking, it is wise to choose honesty as it can foster strong relationships and lead towards positive growth.. It can also help to build meaningful relationships, as lies can inevitably be uncovered, which can damage relationships and damage trust. Another example may include a white lie to spare a friend from knowing the truth about a scenario which has no bearing on the outcome.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to recognize that honesty is generally the best policy. Telling the truth is a way of showing respect and demonstrating trustworthiness. On certain occasions, honesty may not always be the best policy - for instance if a person can be saved from emotional harm by telling a white lie. \n\nUltimately, each situation should be judged on a case by case basis. For example, if someone you know is wearing a terrible outfit, telling them it looks great may avoid them feeling embarrassed and hurt.

It may not be easy but, as Emerson said, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.” We should remember this and be resilient in the pursuit of our dreams.. But the journey wasn’t easy - I had to work hard, face rejection and put in extra hours outside of my day job.

In time, I finally got my foot in the door and realized my goals. \nWhen it comes to being resilient and striving towards your goals, Ralph Waldo Emerson had some wise words. As Les Brown reminds us, \"One of the greatest gifts you can give to yourself is the gift of resilience. The ability to bounce back and rise above whatever challenges life brings.\" True resilience involves focusing on the end result and never giving up - no matter how long the journey may be. Henry Ward Beecher believed that, “One unerring mark of the love of truth is not entertaining any proposition with greater assurance than the proofs it is built upon will warrant.” This teaches us to be open-minded and mindful of the circumstances and situations that we face - while remaining resilient and focused on our goals"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Human-Like: Many people think that if you're so expert and mastered you'll have a really good future , but some people think that the more time you're trying to do the think that you want you'll miss time on your life because the only thing that it's important to you is that think that you really want.\n\nSome people try a lot a things but if they didn't get and they fail and some of they stop what they wanted ,but some of them keep trying and trying their best to get what they want, always try your best and don't give up, when your families or friends tell you that you will not grow more or nothings don't belief that because your're more strong that you know just keep doing and if you're a expert doing that thing you like you'll grow a lot because you have to demonstrate to the people that who you're what you can do.

The thing that you already done and you was doing and everything was wrong,what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is not right because doing something that you already done but you didn't get it that's doesn't mean that you life is done or you will never grow that's wrong, when you're sure that what you want you'll be fairing for that thing that you'll lose for many times but you'll be fairing for that and you'll not get tired until you get your dream.\n\nMy father is a singer and he's very strong and he really know what he want, one day he participated on one big project about music, he was a really good singer but on the day of the presentation he completely lose his voice, but he won the presentation trying he's best , when he won many people tall him that they wanna to do a big different projects with him ,and now he is a big star and he grow a lot, that;s means that if you try something you'll grow a lot because you have to belief and be very sure what you want and if see if you like, never give up just like me, when I came to United Estates I didn't speak any English and it was difficult to stay here and don't know any English all my homework and my project was difficult, but I didn't give up and i'm steel growing a lot and i have been trying a lot a things and I steel growing. steel faith for that and i'm not agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is wrong just keep wronging and never stop everything depends on you..

In the present, technology has allowed people to connect across physical boundaries in ways that were previously impossible. \n\nTo counterbalance the potential issues caused by technology, people should prioritize face-to-face interaction, foster empathy during conversations, and be mindful of their own technology use. Social movements, including those focused on education reform and civil rights, have been effectively organized through technology. This has been linked to aggressive behavior when people are told to limit their use of technology, as well as a general lack of social awareness and inability to interpret body language. \n\nIn the past, technology had limited importance in society.

Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their\"world\" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are.

With such a change, school holidays would need to be structured differently, but it could provide more consistent learning opportunities for students throughout the year.. Having a more balanced learning pattern can also help to reduce stress experienced during peak periods such as exam periods and motivation levels. \n\nLonger winter breaks can often be beneficial for students to enjoy time with family and friends, as well as providing the opportunity to engage in leisure activities and mental health-promoting activities, such as skiing or snowboarding. Having a short week-long break in each season of the year- such as fall, winter and spring - can help to refresh, relax and restore both the mind and body, helping to promote academic success. Shorter summer breaks, like 3-4 week long holidays, enable students to maintain a steady learning cadence throughout the year, rather than having to absorb large capacities of knowledge after an extended holiday. \n\nOne potential benefit of making schools year round is that students may retain knowledge for longer without having to reinvest in the same topic after lengthy school breaks, leading to greater learning outcomes and better long-term memory. \nShort summer breaks may provide a number of advantages to students, such as the opportunity to recharge and relax for a few weeks leads to refreshed minds and healthier bodies, allowing students to return to school with renewed energy and enthusiasm"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Human-Like: I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active.

Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family.\n\nThe last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends.

Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.\n\nI believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school.

This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesn't serve a purpose. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools.\n\nBeing a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Even machines don't work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. Doesn't the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. We hope to do so much but can't accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Don't they need any break. It will always hunt you in your dreams. If you can't have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell 'no' sometimes. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life.

Another example: One boy is working in one project by the school, but the boy want to work alone, the boy said if he working with your partner never to finish the job. is better to be solitaire because you can achieve a lot beautiful things alone, and when you make everything you need to take your time and relax yourself.

The nicest scene is not just that, but also when the night is coming.
